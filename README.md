# Classsroom-Insights
   Classroom Insights is a simple software designed to compute various statistical metrics from a csv-file/database of students' and teachers' performance records. 
It was designed to be the teacher's companion when drafting end-of-sequence or end-of-year reports on classroom performances. This software features
tools to evaluate the teacher's own pedagogic performance against expected metrics. Classroom Insights will allow the teacher to have a unique
 perspective on their performance as well as on those of their students, and provide insights into how these performance indices may be improved upon.
As a bonus, Classroom Insights is designd to allow for archiving of statistics per sequence into a database file which can be shared with other 
colleagues for  more comprehensive perspective on performance.
